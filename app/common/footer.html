                <h6>The Story of South Coast Swords</h6>
                <p class="small">
                    As Kron started to become a large club we began to negotiate for bulk purchases to pass on discounts to club members. New members were warned not to buy anything before first checking with the “Kron Giant Shopping Robot”. The KGSR would also buy odd sword collections, snapping up some good swords among wallhangers (which explains the occasional wallhanger on our website).
                </p>
                <p class="small">Soon, friends of Kron in other clubs learned about the KGSR and asked to get in on the “deals”. At this point we realized that the more friends we included, the better deals we could make, and so we decided to open a HEMA store.  Thus, South Coast Swords was born.</p>
